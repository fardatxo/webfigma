README - Prototype delivered
Files:
- index.html : main responsive page (desktop / tablet / mobile)
- styles.css : styles and responsive layout
- script.js : interactions (language toggle, mobile menu, product injection, simple animation)
How to use:
1. Unzip and open index.html in a browser.
2. The page adapts to desktop/tablet/mobile. The mobile bottom navigation and overlay menu are functional.
3. Language toggle switches Spanish/Portuguese.
Notes:
- Images are placeholder (via.placeholder.com) to keep the prototype standalone.
- The SVG in the hero simulates the requested "animation with drawings" for the bread process.
You can paste the HTML/CSS into Figma as code snippets or import images/screenshots to build the Figma prototype.
